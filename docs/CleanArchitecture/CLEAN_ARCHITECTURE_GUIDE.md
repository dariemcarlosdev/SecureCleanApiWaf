## 📖 Overview

This guide explains how SecureCleanApiWaf implements Clean Architecture principles within a **single-project monolithic structure**. This approach provides the benefits of clear architectural organization while maintaining the speed and simplicity of single-project development.

**What is Clean Architecture?**

Clean Architecture is a design philosophy that organizes code into layers with clear responsibilities, where:

- ? **Business logic is independent** of frameworks and databases
- ? **Dependencies flow inward** to core business rules
- ? **High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules** (both depend on abstractions)
- ? **The system is testable** without external dependencies
- ? **Technology is pluggable** - swap frameworks without rewriting business logic

---

## 💡 Why Clean Architecture?

### **Problems We're Solving**

? **Without Clean Architecture:**
- Difficult to test business logic without entire framework
- Tightly coupled to specific database or API frameworks
- Hard to understand code flow and dependencies
- Difficult for team members to contribute effectively
- Technology changes become expensive rewrites

### **Solutions Clean Architecture Provides**

? **With Clean Architecture:**
- Testable business logic in complete isolation
- Framework-agnostic business rules
- Clear code organization and flow
- Team members understand structure immediately
- Easy to swap technologies (EF Core ? Dapper, Azure ? AWS)

### **For SecureCleanApiWaf Specifically**

Your project already has strong foundations:
- ? CQRS with MediatR (command/query separation)
- ? Pipeline behaviors (cross-cutting concerns)
- ? Dependency injection (loose coupling)
- ? Result pattern (consistent error handling)
- ? Service-based architecture (separation of concerns)
- ✅ **Domain Layer Implementation - 85% Complete** ??

**Clean Architecture takes these to the next level** by formalizing layer boundaries and adding structure.

## ??? Architecture Principles

### **Principle 1: Dependency Rule**

> **All dependencies point inward. Nothing in an inner layer knows about outer layers.**

```
+-----------------------------------------+
�         PRESENTATION LAYER              �
�  (Controllers, API, Blazor Components)  �
�                                         �
�  ? Depends on                          �
+-----------------------------------------+
            ?
+-----------------------------------------+
�       INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER              �
�  (Database, APIs, Services, Caching)    �
�                                         �
�  ? Depends on                          �
+-----------------------------------------+
            ?
+-----------------------------------------+
�       APPLICATION LAYER                 �
�  (Use Cases, CQRS, MediatR)             �
�                                         �
�  ? Depends on                          �
+-----------------------------------------+
            ?
+-----------------------------------------+
�         DOMAIN LAYER                    �
�  (Business Rules, Entities, Logic)      �
�                                         �
�  ? Depends on NOTHING                 �
+-----------------------------------------+
```

### **Principle 2: Abstractions Over Implementations**

Inner layers define **what** needs to be done (interfaces).  
Outer layers provide **how** to do it (implementations).

```csharp
// APPLICATION LAYER - Defines the contract
public interface IApiIntegrationService
{
    Task<Result<T>> GetAllDataAsync<T>(string apiUrl);
}

// INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER - Provides implementation
public class ApiIntegrationService : IApiIntegrationService
{
    // Implementation using IHttpClientFactory
}

// PRESENTATION LAYER - Uses via MediatR
[ApiController]
public class SampleController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator; // Only depends on abstractions
}
```

### **Principle 3: Separation of Concerns**

Each component has a **single, well-defined responsibility**.

| Layer | Responsibility | Examples |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Domain** | Pure business rules (testable without framework) | User entity, Email value object, business validations |
| **Application** | Use cases and orchestration (CQRS) | LoginUserCommand, GetApiDataQuery, pipeline behaviors |
| **Infrastructure** | External concerns (frameworks, APIs, databases) | ApiIntegrationService, caching, EF Core |
| **Presentation** | User interaction (web/API) | Controllers, Blazor components, request models |

### ?? Dependency Rules Table

| Layer | Can Reference | Cannot Reference | Why? |
|-------|--------------|------------------|------|
| **Domain** | Nothing | Application, Infrastructure, Presentation | Must remain pure - no framework dependencies |
| **Application** | Domain only | Infrastructure, Presentation | Defines abstractions; implementations inject at runtime |
| **Infrastructure** | Application, Domain | Presentation | Implements Application interfaces; never controls UI |
| **Presentation** | All layers | None (top layer) | Orchestrates all layers; entry point for requests |

### ?? Dependency Violations (Anti-Patterns)

**? NEVER DO THIS:**

```csharp
// Domain referencing Application ?
namespace SecureCleanApiWaf.Core.Domain.Entities;
using SecureCleanApiWaf.Core.Application.Interfaces; // WRONG!

// Application referencing Infrastructure ?
namespace SecureCleanApiWaf.Core.Application.Features;
using SecureCleanApiWaf.Infrastructure.Services; // WRONG!
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**

```csharp
// Application defines interface ?
namespace SecureCleanApiWaf.Core.Application.Common.Interfaces;
public interface IApiIntegrationService
{
    Task<Result<T>> GetAllDataAsync<T>(string apiUrl);
}

// Infrastructure implements interface ?
namespace SecureCleanApiWaf.Infrastructure.Services;
using SecureCleanApiWaf.Core.Application.Common.Interfaces;

public class ApiIntegrationService : IApiIntegrationService
{
    // Implementation...
}
```

### **Benefits of Single-Project Approach**

? **Fast Development** - Quick builds, no project reference management  
? **Simple Structure** - Easy to navigate, less complexity  
? **Clear Organization** - Folder-based layer separation  
? **Perfect for Solo/Small Teams** - Maintains development velocity

---

## 🏢 Multi-Project Solution Layout

For **larger teams** or **enterprise applications**, consider this structure:

```
SecureCleanApiWaf.sln
+-- Core/
�   +-- SecureCleanApiWaf.Domain/           # Pure business logic
�   +-- SecureCleanApiWaf.Application/      # Use cases & interfaces
+-- Infrastructure/
�   +-- SecureCleanApiWaf.Infrastructure/   # Generic infrastructure
�   +-- SecureCleanApiWaf.Infrastructure.Azure/  # Azure-specific
+-- Presentation/
    +-- SecureCleanApiWaf.Web/              # Blazor + API
```

**When to Consider Multi-Project:**
- Team size > 5 developers
- Need strict boundary enforcement
- Sharing domain logic across multiple UIs
- Long-term enterprise application

---

## 🎯 Implementation Guidance

### **Data Transformation Patterns** ??

SecureCleanApiWaf implements a **hybrid mapping strategy** for transforming data between layers:

**AutoMapper for Known Structures:**
```csharp
// Known API structure with strongly-typed DTO
var apiDto = await _apiService.GetAllDataAsync<ApiItemDto>(url);
var domainEntity = _autoMapper.Map<ApiDataItem>(apiDto);
```

**Custom Mapper for Dynamic APIs:**
```csharp
// Unknown/dynamic API structure
var dynamicResponse = await _apiService.GetAllDataAsync<dynamic>(url);
var domainEntities = _customMapper.MapToApiDataItems(dynamicResponse, url);
```

**When to Use Each:**
- ? **AutoMapper** ? Internal APIs, known structures, Entity?DTO conversions
- ? **Custom Mapper** ? Third-party APIs, varying property names, dynamic structures

?? **Full Guide:** [Hybrid Mapping Strategy Documentation](HYBRID-MAPPING-STRATEGY.md)

---

### **Authentication with CQRS** ? Featured Pattern

SecureCleanApiWaf uses **CQRS with MediatR** for authentication:

```
Authentication Flow:
  Controller ? MediatR ? Command/Query Handler ? Service ? Response
```

**Login Command Example:**
```csharp
// 1. Command
public record LoginUserCommand(
    string Username,
    string Password,
    string Role
) : IRequest<Result<LoginResponse>>;

// 2. Handler (Application Layer)
public class LoginUserCommandHandler 
    : IRequestHandler<LoginUserCommand, Result<LoginResponse>>
{
    private readonly IJwtTokenGenerator _tokenGenerator;
    
    public async Task<Result<LoginResponse>> Handle(...)
    {
        // Business logic: validate, generate JWT, return response
    }
}

// 3. Controller (Presentation Layer)
[HttpPost("login")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginRequest request)
{
    var command = new LoginUserCommand(request.Username, request.Password, request.Role);
    var result = await _mediator.Send(command);
    return result.Success ? Ok(result.Data) : BadRequest(result.Error);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ? Clean separation (Controller handles HTTP, Handler contains logic)
- ? Testable (handlers can be unit tested independently)
- ? Consistent error handling (Result<T> pattern)
- ? Automatic caching (via ICacheable interface)

### **Domain Entity Creation Pattern**

All entities use factory methods for creation:

```csharp
// User entity
var email = Email.Create("user@example.com");
var user = User.Create("johndoe", email, hashedPassword);
user.AssignRole(Role.Admin);

// Token entity
var token = Token.Create(
    userId: user.Id,
    username: user.Username,
    expiresAt: DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(60),
    type: TokenType.AccessToken
);

// ApiDataItem entity
var dataItem = ApiDataItem.CreateFromExternalSource(
    externalId: "123",
    name: "Sample Data",
    description: "Description",
    sourceUrl: "https://api.example.com/data/123"
);
```

## ✅ Best Practices

### **Domain Layer**
- ? Use factory methods for entity creation
- ? Validate in constructors/factory methods
- ? Use value objects to prevent primitive obsession
- ? Throw DomainException for business rule violations
- ? Keep entities rich with behavior (not anemic)

### **Application Layer**
- ? Use MediatR for CQRS pattern
- ? Define interfaces for all infrastructure dependencies
- ? Use Result<T> pattern for error handling
- ? Implement pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns

### **Infrastructure Layer**
- ? Implement Application layer interfaces
- ? Use HttpClientFactory for external APIs
- ? Use distributed caching for scalability
- ? Log all infrastructure operations

### **Presentation Layer**
- ? Keep controllers thin (delegate to MediatR)
- ? Use DTOs for API requests/responses
- ? Implement proper error handling middleware
- ? Version your APIs

## 📝 Summary

### **What SecureCleanApiWaf Achieves**

✅ **Clear Architecture** - Layers separated by responsibility  
✅ **Domain Layer** - 85% complete with rich entities and value objects  
✅ **CQRS Pattern** - Commands and queries separated via MediatR  
✅ **Testability** - Business logic independent of frameworks  
✅ **Flexibility** - Easy to swap implementations  
✅ **Scalability** - Team can work on different features  
✅ **Maintainability** - Clear code organization and flow  

### **Domain Layer Highlights**

- **12 files** with ~3,250 lines of domain code
- **3 entities**: User (authentication/roles), Token (JWT lifecycle), ApiDataItem (API sync)
- **2 value objects**: Email (RFC validation), Role (permission hierarchy)
- **4 enums**: UserStatus, TokenStatus, TokenType, DataStatus
- **100% documented** with XML comments and usage examples

### **Next Steps**

1. ? **Review** the domain entities and value objects
2. ? **Create** EF Core configurations for entities
3. ? **Write** unit tests for domain logic
4. 🔗 **Integrate** with Application layer handlers
5. ? **Update** repositories to use entities

### **Key Takeaways**

- 🏛️ Clean Architecture is about **organization and boundaries**, not file count
- ? **Single-project is fine** for most teams (< 20 developers)
- ? **Use abstractions** to enforce dependency rules
- ? **Keep Domain pure** - no external dependencies
- ? **CQRS + MediatR** provides excellent structure
- ? **Rich domain models** are more maintainable than anemic ones
